====================== Switches ======================

- Switching is the process of data WITHIN a network
  - Switches are devices whose primary purpose is switching
- Therefore, all devices commmunicating through a switch belong to the same network

- Switches use and maintain a MAC Address Table (Switch Port --> MAC Address)
  - Each connection to a switch from a device will have a "Switch Port" number. These numbers are generated by the switch.

   |  9  -->    c3c3   |
   [  10 -->    d4d4   ]

Switches can only perform THREE actions: Learn, Flood, Forward

1. Learn:
   - When a frame arrives at the Switch, the switch records the source MAC address and the corresponding port number in its 
MAC address table.

2. Flood:
   - If the switch doesn't know the destination port for a received frame (e.g., the destination MAC address is not in its 
table), it "floods" the frame to all ports except the one it arrived on.
   - This ensures that the frame reaches its destination even if the switch hasn't learned its location yet.

3. Forward:
   - Once the switch has learned the MAC addresses of connected devices, it can forward frames directly to the specific port 
connected to the destination device.
   - This unicast transmission is more efficient than flooding, as it sends the frame only to the intended recipient.

|    Host B   |                                               |    Router   |---/
[   MAC:b2b2  ]                                               [   MAC:d4d4  ]
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                                                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The process would be identical if Host ? was a Router connected to the Internet.

Switches are ONLY concerned with the Layer 2 Header. They do not care about Layer 3 Headers. 


========== OVERVIEW ==========

- Data THROUGH a Switch
Switches have a MAC Address, as well as an IP Address.
However, when we are sending data through a switch, the IP/MAC Address of the Switch is ignored.

The switch has a MAC Address table, where it has mappings of the Switch Port and connected host MAC Address saved.
LEARN: If the switch doesn't have a record of the frame's source MAC Address in it's MAC Table, it will LEARN the mapping and save it to its table.
FLOOD: If the switch doesn't know the mapping for the destination MAC Address, it will flood every port with the data.
FORWARD: If the switch finds the destination MAC Address in its MAC Address Table, it'll be able to simply FORWARD the data directly to the destination
This is done in unicast transmission, as flooding is inefficient. it sends the frame only to the intended recipient.


- Data TO a Switch
If we wanted to send data TO a switch, the switch would essentially act as a host.
The switch would have to follow all the communication rules of a host.
