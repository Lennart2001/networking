======================== Unicast & Broadcast ========================

Unicast Frame:
- The destination MAC Address is another host
- A Switch will only FLOOD if the destination MAC Address is not in the MAC Address Table of the Switch
- Unicast Frames are occasionally FLOODED

- Occurs when a switch receives a unicast frame (a frame intended for a specific destination MAC address) but doesn't have an entry for that destination MAC address in its MAC address table.
- The switch floods the frame to all ports (except the incoming port), treating it similarly to a broadcast frame.
- Ensures that the frame reaches its destination, even if the switch doesn't know which port that destination is connected to.


Broadcast Frame:
- The destination MAC Address is ffff.ffff.ffff
- This is a specially reserved MAC Address, which tells the switch to FLOOD
- If Host A sends a ARP Request it will send its MAC Address as source, and the destination as ffff.ffff.ffff
- The LEARN process is the same, with ARP Requests and Unicast sends.
- Broadcast Frames are ALWAYS FLOODED

- Refers to a frame that is explicitly intended for all devices within a broadcast domain (e.g., a frame with a destination MAC address of ffff.ffff.ffff).
- The switch forwards the broadcast frame to all ports within the same VLAN or broadcast domain (except the incoming port).
- Used to discover devices, request information, or perform other tasks that require communicating with all devices within a broadcast domain.


- Broadcast and Unicast are both an actual type of Frame.
- The FLOOD is an action taken by the Switch.
   - The Switch can only take THREE actions: Learn, Flood, and Forward

- If traffic goes THROUGH a switch, the switch will never broadcast anything.
- If traffic goes TO or FROM a switch, it may send Broadcasts.
   - This only works because there the "Switch" acts as a HOST not a Switch.


======================== VLANs (Virtual Local Area Network) ========================

VLANs allows the dividing of Switch Ports into Isolated Groups.
   - Each division acts as a "mini switch"
   - All of these switches have the same functionality as the others
      - They also LEARN, FLOOD and FORWARD frames
      - Each "mini switch" has its own MAC Address Table
      - They truly are mini switches
   - All we are doing is confining a specific set of actions to a certain selection of ports.

VLANS allow you to create smaller "mini switches" inside the larger Switch,
thereby isolating the hosts connected to the individual switches.
   - Devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they are on the same physical switch.
   - Devices in different VLANs on the same switch cannot communicate directly, even though they are on the same physical hardware.

VLANs within a switch are logically isolated from each other and act as separate broadcast domains.
Even if they originate from the same physical switch, communication between different VLANs is
not allowed by default at Layer 2.

VLAN A cannot communicate with VLAN B.                                                          

======================== Multiple Switches Network ========================

Similar to VLANs, Multiple Switches in a network all have their own MAC Address Table
   - Switches perform switch actions independently
       - If one switch knows where to go it won't FLOOD
       - If one switch doesn't know it will FLOOD
       - Again, these actions are independent from another

================ OVERVIEW ================


Unicast Flooding is a switch's response to a unicast frame when the destination is unknown,
whereas Broadcast is a deliberate communication to all devices within a broadcast domain.


By now it should be clear that VLANs and multiple Switches behave differently.
   - VLANs are based on the same switch, logically dividing itself.
       - VLANs cannot communicate with each other.
       - Unless other Layer 3 devices (Routers) are introduced.
   - Multiple switches are physically divided. They are different devices.
       - If there are multiple switches on the same network like shown above in Multiple Switches Network,
         every host in that network can communicate with one another.
