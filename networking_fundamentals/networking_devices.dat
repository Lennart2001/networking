======================================== NETWORK DEVICES ========================================

1) Hosts are any device which requests data from some other device.
2) Servers are any device which can send data upon request.
3) IP Addresses are are the identity of every Host(1) - similar to a street address: Country.State.City.Street.House 
4) Networks transport traffic between hosts. If two computers are connected, then this constitutes a network.
   - Networks are a grouping of hosts.
5) Sub-Networks (Subnets) are the logical grouping of hosts. For instance, routers create sub-networks.
   - Subnets are logical grouping of interconnected network devices. The subdivision of a network into smaller networks helps to 
improve network performance and security. Devices on the same subnet have IP addresses that fall within the same range as defined by a 
subnet mask.
6) Repeaters are there to ensure that data doesn't deteriorate/diminish during travel. If two hosts are far away from each other, data 
decays during travel. To prevent this, repeaters repeat the data and "fix" or "re-generate" it which allows them to continue to 
travel far.
   - This allows for hosts to be far away from each other.
   - The scaling is not linear:
     N: Number of Hosts
     M_[N]: Number of Connections for N Hosts
     M_0 = 0
     Formula: (N-1) + (M_[N-1]) = M_[N]
     Example2:
     N = 1
     (1-1) + (M_0) = M_1
     ** 0 = M_1 **
     N = 2
     (2-1) + (M_1) = M_2
     (1) + (0) = M_2
     If, there is only one host: No connections to other hosts.
     If, there is two hosts: One connection between the hosts.
     Other formula = Edges = N * (N-1) / 2
7) Hubs are, simply put, a multi-port repeater. Hubs also re-generate data. If a host sends data to the hub, the hub then sends out all 
of the re-generated (fresh) data to the remaining hosts.
   - Hubs also facilitate scaling. 
   - The scaling is linear. Only one new connection per new computer. Edges = N
8) Bridges sit between hub-connected networks. They also only have two ports. They are also able to learn which computers 
sit on which side of the bridge.
   - A bridge has two sides: Side "A" and side "B". Computers on side A have to go through the bridge to get to side B. 
   - Bridges are able to "learn" on which side the computer sits, thus improving efficiency of the network.

9) Switches facilitate communications WITHIN  a network. They are a combination of Hubs(7) and Bridges(8).
   - Switches act like a hub, where they are able to send traffic from any port to any other port. 
   - Switches are alos like a bridge, where they can learn where to send the traffic. Meaning, they are able to destinguish 
between certain traffic.
   - Unlike Bridges, Switches have multiple ports.

10) Routers facilitate communications BETWEEN different networks. 
    - Routers are what allow your devices to communicate other networks.
    - Since the internet is one huge network, routers are what enable communication with the internet.
    - Routers provide a traffic control point. They secure, filter and redirect traffic. 
    - They are the first line of defense against cyber attacks.
    - Routers are a bottleneck for traffic. It is logical to apply security policies to the router. Hence, first line of 
defense.
    - Traditionally, switches could not perform filtering - However, some modern switches are able to do so.
    - Routers have their own IP Address, which allows their hosts to exit the network. Meaning, the Routers IP Address is 
the Gateway for the individual hosts. (Shown in 11)

   - If a host in [Network 3] wants to send data to [Network 6], the data will travel like this:

[Network 3] -> [Router 3] -> [Router 4] -> [Internet] -> [Router 5] -> [Router 8] -> [Network 6]


11) Gateways are a host's way out of the local Network.
    - If the host wishes to communicate to a different machine/host on a different network, they will have to use the local 
network's gateway to exit their current local network.

    - If host in Network 1 wants to talk to host in Network 2, it will have to go through the Router


12) Routing Tables are all the networks a Router(10) knows about. 
    - Routers are able to learn which Networks they are attached to.
    - These learned networks are called "routes" and are stored in the routing table.

13) Routing is the process of moving data between networks.
    - A Router is a device, whose primary purpose is routing.

14) Switching is the process of moving data within a network.
    - A Switch is a device, whose primary purpose is switching.
