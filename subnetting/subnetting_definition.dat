============================= Subnetting Range 25 -> 32 =============================


Subnetting is taking a network and dividing it into smaller sub-networks

It is also possible to "mix and match" with the subnets

There are seven attributes of Subnetting:

Network ID
  - A Network ID represents the first possible IP address in a subnet
  - So, for the #1 subnet the Network ID would be 10.0.0.0
  - For subnet #3 the Network ID would be 10.0.0.160
  - A Host can't be assigned the Network ID IP Address
  - The purpose of a Network ID 

Broadcast IP
  - The Broadcast IP is the last possible IP Address in a subnet
  - So, for the #1 subnet the Broadcast IP would be 10.0.0.127
  - For subnet #3 the Broadcast I_ would be 10.0.0.191
  - The purpose of a Broadcast IP is to send the data to every single Host in the Network

First Host IP
  - First IP Address after the Network ID

Last Host IP
  - The Last usable IP Address - the last IP Address before Broadcast IP

The idea behind the first host IP and last host IP is to give us a range of usable Host Addresses
  - This is important because sometimes there are certain IP Addresses assigned for other tasks
    which means we can't have a host be that particular IP Address

Next Network
  - Is the Network ID of the NEXT Sub-Network
  - The Next Network will always be the IP Address after the Broadcast IP Address

# IP Addresses
  - Is the total number of addresses inside a Sub-Network

CIDR/Subnet
  - CIDR is a type of notation which is displayed as /0, /1,..., /24, /25,....
  - A Subnet Mask on the other hand displays a full "IP Address"
    - A subnet Mask can look like this: 255.255.255.0 = /24
                                        255.255.255.128 = /25
                                        255.255.255.192 = /26
                                        255.255.255.224 = /27
