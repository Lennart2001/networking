====================== Twice Network Address Translation ======================


Every type of NAT we have mentioned has one thing in common:
  - Each translation only translated the SOURCE of the Packet (for OUTBOUND)
  

In Twice NAT, we are translating the Source and the Destination of a Packet:
  - Packets are still translated using:
    - Static NAT, Static PAT, Dynamic NAT, Dynamic PAT

|  └------------------------┘        |   - Static NAT destination to 32.9.1.8               |

*Notice how we changed the Source and the Destination of the           ┌------------------------┐
 packet.                                                               | SRC:  32.8.2.55:5555   |
                                                                       | DEST: 32.9.1.8 :53     |
                                                                       └------------------------┘
However, also notice that we did a POLICY NAT.
  - This is because we are matching the Source and Destination
    - If source is 10.6.6.0/24 and destination is 8.8.8.8

The Twice NAT comes from "Two times NAT" -> NAT the Source AND NAT the Destination
